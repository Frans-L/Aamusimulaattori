# Aamusimulaattori

Aamusimulaattori is a humorous FPS simulator about the Finnish military service. The demo is made with Unity in 3 weeks. The player wakes up in a tent and he has to keep a stove warm as long as possible. 

**Note**: Originally, this project wasn't open source.  The project is moved here in November 2017 - 4 months after the first release.

## Motivation

The idea was to develop a game demo into Assembly Summer 17 in 3 weeks. Our motivation was to learn to use Unity 5 which none of us had used before.

## Description

Aamusimulaattori is made with Unity 5.6. It's a humorous FPS simulator about the Finnish military service. The object is to keep a stove warm as long as possible.
When there are no more logs, the player can pick up anything and throw it into the stove. Every game object (stones, trees, soldiers, sleeping bags etc.) can be picked up and used as fuel.
There are also useful items like an axe that player can use to cut trees. The demo has ridiculous physics and absurd content. It is inspired by My Summer Car and Goat Simulator.
The demo is only in Finnish.

The project has normal Unity's project structure, so the C# scripts are at:
