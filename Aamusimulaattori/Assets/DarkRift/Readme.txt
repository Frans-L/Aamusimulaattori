Hello there!

Thank you for choosing DarkRift Servers for you project, we hope that you'll find them to be perfect for your 
games!

The package you've downloaded has 4 examples in it, CubeDemo, Player Demo, a varient of the CubeDemo 
showing manual serialisation, a varient of CubeDemo using a Unity based server and the HeavySyncDemo. You should also find the
server, the API and some documentation for you. Within each folder is a Readme file to get you started.

I reccomend you start with the CubeDemo and PlayerDemo to get the basics.

If you find yourself stuck or you want to make suggestions please don't hesitate to email Jamie.Read@outlook.com
for help :)

You might also find stuff at DarkRift.NinjaPokeStudios.co.uk
